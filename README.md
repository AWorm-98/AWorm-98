- 👋 Hi, I’m @AWorm-98
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Computer Science and work towards a career shift once I'm there. Maybe getting into software development or looking at cyber-security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning introduction to CS from the HarvardX CS50X program.
- 💞️ I’m not sure if I'm ready to collaborate on things yet but I'm eager to get there! I'm more than willing and able to learn and figure problems out.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at aworm98@gmail.com
